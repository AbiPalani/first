difference between node js and browser js:
Node JS:
	1.It executes Js in server side
	2.In this, everything is a module.We must keep our code inside a module.
	3.Node processes request object.
	4.It doesn't have a predefined window object because it doesn't have a window to draw anything.
	5.Require object is prdefined in node Js, which is used to include modules in the app.
Browser JS:
	1.Browser Js executes in client side.
	2.Module is not mandatory in client side js.
	3.Browser processes responce object.
	4.Window is predefined global object, which has functions and attributes, that have to deal with window that has drawn.
	5.Browser doesn't have require predefined object, we may include it in our own app for asynchronous file loading 


Summary points of the video:
	It shows how the browser render a website
	 *It takes Parsing, Rendering, Layout and painting, the following shows how the browser render a website:- 
		1.Parsing the Html and css create a DOM tree and CSSOM tree.
		2.These DOM tree and CSSOM tree combined and create a Render Tree.
		3.There are actually four trees in the render part:"RENDER OBJECTS, RENDER STYLES,LAYERS, LINEBOXES".
		4.Layout computes where a node will be on the screen.
		5.Paint computes bitmaps and composites to screen.
		6.Performance Insight for better result.


Read:
	*For file optimization and scannability omitting the tags are allowed.
	*But it has effects such as makes it harder for browser authors to write correct implementations and some tag misplacement.
	*Finally, omitting the tags may give the complexity.
